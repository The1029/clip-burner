# Clip Burner
Simple CLI tool to read Kindle highlights and convert them to markdown quotes.

Offers the option to copy to the clipboard, or write to a file.

## Usage
Drop your `My Clippings.txt` file into the same directory as `index.js`, then run `npm run start`.

**Tip:** The book selection list is arranged in order that the books appear in your `My Clippings.txt` file, first to last. To reach latest books, scroll up instead of down (the list rolls over).
